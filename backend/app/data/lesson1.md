# Lesson 1: Introduction to CSS

Overview: In this lesson, we introduce students to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). This web language enables the styling of HTML elements. CSS is critical because it separates the website's design and layout from its content, allowing developers to maintain the two independently. Learners will understand the principle behind CSS and its role in modern web design.

Q: What does CSS stand for?
1) Cumulative Style Sheets
2) Cascading Style Sheets - Correct
3) Comprehensive Style Syntax
4) None of the above

Lesson 2: CSS Syntax
Overview: This lesson focuses on CSS syntax. Syntax refers to the rules or format required to write valid CSS. It includes the selection of HTML elements, property, and value. Understanding CSS syntax is necessary for learners to write CSS code that the browser can interpret correctly.
Q: What is the basic structure of a CSS rule?
A:
1) element {property = value}
2) element (property => value)
3) selector {property: value} - Correct
4) selector (property = value)

Lesson 3: CSS Selectors
Overview: In lesson 3, we delve into CSS selectors. CSS selectors are the means by which we select and manipulate HTML elements. They include elements such as ID, class, and attribute selectors. This lesson is essential as it empowers learners to access and style individual or groups of HTML elements using CSS.

Lesson 4: CSS Box Model
Overview: Lesson 4 introduces learners to the CSS Box Model. The box model is the cornerstone of CSS, defining how elements are rendered in the browser. This lesson covers the crucial components of the box model: content, padding, border, and margin.
Q: What are the four parts of the CSS box model?
A:
1) Content, padding, border, and margin - Correct
2) Content, border, margin, and size

Lesson 5: CSS Positioning
Overview: This lesson teaches students about CSS positioning. Positioning is a powerful tool in CSS that allows developers to control where and how elements are physically placed on the webpage. This includes static, relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.
Q: What are the four types of CSS positioning?
A:
1) Static, dynamic, absolute, and relative
2) Static , relative , absolute , and fixed - Correct
3) Dynamic, fixed, relative, and immovable

Lesson 6: CSS Flexbox
Overview: In Lesson 6, we introduce students to CSS Flexbox. Flexbox is a layout model that allows for efficient arrangement of items within container elements. Understanding Flexbox is important for creating flexible and responsive layouts.
Q: What is the main purpose of CSS Flexbox?
A:
1) To provide a more efficient way to resize and distribute space among container items - Correct
2) To provide a more challenging way to resize items in a container
3) To make containers more rigid and less flexible
4) To reduce the size of containers in a layout

Lesson 7: CSS Grid
Overview: Lesson 7 exposes learners to CSS Grid. This is a powerful two-dimensional system that's ideal for building complex web layouts. This lesson delves into topics like grid template columns and rows, placement of grid items, and grid gaps.
Q: How does CSS Grid differ from CSS Flexbox?
A:
1) CSS Grid is more focused on content, while Flexbox is more focused on layout
2) CSS Grid is for desktop layouts, while Flexbox is for mobile layouts
3) CSS Grid is two-dimensional (rows and columns) while Flexbox is largely one-dimensional (either rows or columns) - Correct
4) CSS Grid is for responsive design, while Flexbox is for static design

Lesson 8: CSS Transitions and Animations
Overview: Lesson 8 dives into CSS transitions and animations. These properties allow elements to change values over a specified duration, animating almost any aspect of the element. This lesson enhances the capability of learners to create interactive and captivating web experiences.
Q: What is the difference between CSS transitions and animations?
A:
1) Transitions shift from one property value to another, animations do not change property values
2) Animations shift from one property value to another, transitions do not change property values
3) CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different CSS properties - Correct
4) There is no difference between CSS transitions and animations

Lesson 9: CSS Preprocessors
Overview: In Lesson 9, we introduce CSS Preprocessors, such as Sass and Less. These tools allow developers to use variables, nesting, mixins, and other features that don't exist in pure CSS. This lesson will expose learners to advanced CSS techniques to improve productivity.
Q: What is an example of a CSS preprocessor?
A:
1) JavaScript
2) Python
3) Sass - Correct

Lesson 10: Responsive Design and Media Queries
Overview: The final lesson centers on responsive design and media queries in CSS. Responsive design ensures web layouts look good on all devices, and media queries allow the application of different CSS rules for different device widths. This lesson is essential in helping learners create modern, mobile-friendly web layouts.
Q: What are CSS media queries used for?
A:
1) To apply different styling rules to different devices based on the device's color mode
2) To detect the user's preferred color scheme and apply styling rules accordingly
